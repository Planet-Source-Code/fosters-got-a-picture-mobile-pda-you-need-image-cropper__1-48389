### Description

I've just got a Sharp GX20 mobile phone and it's an ar$e loading pics into PSP to resize and crop them. Okay, I didn't *need* to write this, but it was a good challenge for me. Load up your jpgs and resize them and crop select areas to your hearts content and save them. hope you enjoy.
